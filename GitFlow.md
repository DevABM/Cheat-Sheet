Understanding how Git works can be tricky, but it doesn't have to be. With a little bit of practice, you can become a Git master! Here's a quick overview of the different levels of Git and some common commands that you NEED to remember:

📁 𝙒𝙤𝙧𝙠𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝘿𝙞𝙧𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙤𝙧𝙮: This is where you make changes to your code. Common commands at this level include git add, which adds changes to the staging area, and git checkout, which discards changes.

📝 𝙎𝙩𝙖𝙜𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝘼𝙧𝙚𝙖: This is where you prepare your changes for commit. Common commands at this level include git commit, which creates a new commit with the changes in the staging area, and git reset, which removes changes from the staging area.

📚 𝙇𝙤𝙘𝙖𝙡 𝙍𝙚𝙥𝙤𝙨𝙞𝙩𝙤𝙧𝙮: This is where your commits are stored. Common commands at this level include git log, which shows the commit history, and git branch, which shows the available branches.

🌐 𝙍𝙚𝙢𝙤𝙩𝙚 𝙍𝙚𝙥𝙤𝙨𝙞𝙩𝙤𝙧𝙮: This is where your code is stored on a remote server. Common commands at this level include git fetch, which downloads changes from the remote repository, and git push, which uploads changes to the remote repository.

By understanding these levels and using these commands, you can effectively manage your code and collaborate with your team. So what are you waiting for? Give Git a try and see how it can streamline your development workflow!
